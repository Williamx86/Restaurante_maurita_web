# Restaurante Maurita web page 🐟

This project was custom developed based on a Photoshop template
## Technologies

- Boostrap 4
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

To style the web page I used the comfortable bootstrap classes but I have also implemented **CSS grids** and **flexbox** to make custom elements
## Team
William Josue Barahona Castillo (Front-end developer) 😅
